Employee Tracker Project

## Objective:

To create application Where user can enter / update / delete Employee Information using CLI / Inquirer / SQL .

Note: The basic requirements were fulfilled ( insert / update / delete ) of SQL tables and the bonus wasn't attempted .

## Software used:

a) Inquirer
b) SQL

1.  Schema
2.  Table Creation

## Development

Inquirer was used to create 3 different scenarios for this project:
a) Add data to tables
b) Update data in tables
c) Delete Data from tables

Other than viewing the tables , if the user chose to manipulate the tables (insert / update / delete) The user would be given a view of the table at its current state , e.g. (if user wanted to add a new employee , a " select " statement would be executed first so the user can visualize the content , then make the adjustment needed and could go back to select " view " to confirm that the changes actually took place ) .

User ability to update was limited to certain columns because the " bonus " wasn't attempted and the columns had corresponding column names in the other tables and could be used for possible " joins " had the " bonus " been attempted .

Enhancements

---

Additional tables can be added to give further diversification to information regarding the employee which means that more joins could take place to bring back requested information.
